## SDG 13: Climate Action

We contribute to **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13**, focusing on subgoals 13.1, 13.2, and 13.3, which address measures to combat climate change and its impacts. By continuously measuring weather data, we provide critical insights into environmental and climate changes to research institutions, NGOs, and governments. These efforts support informed scientific analyses essential for environmental and human protection.

- **13.1** Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.
- **13.2** Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning.
- **13.3** Improve education, awareness, and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and impact reduction.

## SDG 14: Life Below Water

We are dedicated to **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14**, which promotes the sustainable use and conservation of oceans and marine resources, particularly subgoals 14.1 and 14.7. Our eco-friendly, durable buoys reduce the need for repairs and replacements, minimizing marine pollution. Additionally, our digital buoy booking system reduces unnecessary trips, enabling more efficient usage and protecting marine ecosystems.

- **14.1** By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, particularly from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.
- **14.7** By 2030, increase the economic benefits to small island developing states and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism.
