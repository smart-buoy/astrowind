# About Us
about:
  hero:
    tagline: "About Us"
    title: "SmartBuoy"
    subtitle: "Who we are"
  intro:
    paragraph1: "SmartBuoy develops smart buoys to make mooring safer, more comfortable and ecologically more responsible. We are skippers, technicians and entrepreneurs with a shared conviction: Technology should make life on the water simpler, not more complicated. And it should protect nature, not pollute it."
    subheadline: "Smart buoys for skippers by skippers"
  story:
    title: "How it all began"
    paragraph1: "SmartBuoy was founded in 2023. The idea originated not in an office, but on a private boat trip."
    paragraph2: "Our founders Michi and Georg, managing directors of a yacht building company, faced an everyday problem: not being able to moor where they actually wanted, but only where a buoy happened to be free."
    bullets: "unnecessary buoy searching|additional trips|fuel waste|stress at the end of an actually beautiful day"
    conclusion: "From this frustration arose a simple question: Why is there no plannable, fair and sustainable solution for buoy spots? The answer is SmartBuoy."
