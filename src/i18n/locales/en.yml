      Protecting coastlines is a core mission of SmartBuoy.
      Through digital booking and clear occupancy management, we reduce unnecessary searching and boat movements on the water - saving fuel and lowering CO₂ emissions.
      The buoy replaces uncontrolled anchoring with a clearly defined, seabed-friendly mooring spot. This helps preserve the seabed as a vital marine habitat.

      Sustainability is also reflected in the product design:
      - planned transition to natural fibers
      - recyclable system design
      - second-life cycle for electronic components

      This extends service life, reduces waste, and makes sustainable maritime infrastructure economically viable.

      **For skippers, this means:**
      - the assurance that the buoy fits the boat
      - predictable, stress-free mooring

      **For operators and regions:**
      - transparent, regulated revenue
      - less administrative effort
      - better utilization of existing infrastructure

      SmartBuoy delivers technology that not only works - but takes responsibility.

  story:
    title: "How it all began"
    paragraph1: "SmartBuoy was founded in 2023.\nThe idea didn’t come from out of an office, it was born during a private boating trip."
    paragraph2: "Our founders, Michi and Georg, the managing director of a yacht-building company, faced an everyday problem:\nNot being able to moor where you actually want to, but only where a buoy happens to still be available.\n\nInstead of a relaxed evening at a favorite restaurant, it meant:"
    bullets: "unnecessary searching for a free buoy|extra trips on the water|wasted fuel|stress at the end of what should have been a beautiful day"
    conclusion: "Out of that frustration came a simple question:\nWhy isn’t there a predictable, fair, and sustainable solution for buoy moorings?\n\nThe answer is SmartBuoy."
